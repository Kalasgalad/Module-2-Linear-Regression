# Module 2 Linear Regression

Introduction:

For this project, I worked with a (canada_rent.csv) containing rental prices for diverse units across Canada in 2024.

My goal is to explore multiple regression models, in order to find a model that predicts the rental price most accurately. 
In this project, I will be comparing a Linear Regression Model, a Simple Polynomial Model, and an ElasticNetCV Model.

## Project Outline

1. The project will begin with an EDA portion to better understand the data, indentify trends, and determine important features useful for regression models.
2. Data will be cleaned and prepared for visualization.
3. Once data has been organized and cleaned, visualization will be included to support my analysis of aforementioned trends. Key variables will be determined for feature engineering.
4. Proceed with feature engineering to formulate three(3) regression models.
5. Compare different regression models & distinguish which will best predict prices.
6. Use final model to make new predictions.

### The criteria for project submission were the following:

- You will upload your completed project in a PUBLIC Github repository in your account.
- Your repository MUST include:
  - a README.md page that includes a description and summary of your analysis.
  - The completed .ipynb notebook with your analysis.
- Your notebook has to be organized and clean. Break down your steps, and follow coding best practices.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*

Performed EDA to understand dataset distribution, trends, and relationships. Used a few visualizations to detect key trends.

Identified missing values, outliers, and categorical/numerical feature distributions. In different cases, adjusted missing values by filling with mode, mean or dropping unnecessary values.

*Feature Engineering*
